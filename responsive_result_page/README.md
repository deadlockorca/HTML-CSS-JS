### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Use `em` or `rem` to size elements (even with padding, margin, ...) instead of `px`.
- Use a `.container` and set its width to 100% to wrap around the whole page for responsive design
